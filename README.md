# ACF-Extractor
This "ACF Extractor" program originally was part of a [series of blog posts](https://blog.defence-force.org/index.php?page=articles&ref=ART73) about Time Commando published in 2021.

This [specific article](https://blog.defence-force.org/index.php?page=articles&ref=ART82) was about the ACF/XCF video format used in the game and is a total rewrite of the code.

It's obviously based on the original documentation and code, but it does not use any of the Adeline code, and only use standard C++17 functionalities.
